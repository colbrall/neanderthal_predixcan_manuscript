Code and data for "Imputing archaic hominin gene regulation reveals divergent regulation and phenotypic differences"

scripts/
    comp_pop.jl 
	calculates empirical p-values, runs PCA and clustering analyses
	requires population predictions and archaic predictions or pre-computed p-values

    comp_inds.jl 
	comparisons of predicted expression between archaic individuals
	requires archaic predictions

    gene_overlap.jl
	intersects gene models and SNPs or regions of interest
	requires lists of regions of interest

    human_dr.jl
        for a set of human IDs, calculates empirical P-value and call DR genes

    intro_individuals.jl
        for each gene, identifies individuals with certain alleles within 1Mb

    metric_summary_by_gene.jl
        generalized version of recombination_rate_map.jl; compares a metric (i.e. gene density) across sets of genes

    model_weights.jl
	stats for comparing model weights between sets of SNPs
	requires model databases, SNP sets

    neanderthal_predixcan_plots.ipynb
        Jupyter notebook for plotting

    PrediXcan.py
        code for performing PrediXcan predictions on genetic information. 
	adapted from script downloaded here on May 19, 2017: https://github.com/hakyimlab/PrediXcan/tree/master/Software

    recombination_rate_map.jl
        calculates recombination rate and summarizes for gene regions, then compares R.R. across gene sets.
