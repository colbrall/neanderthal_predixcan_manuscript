scripts/
    comp_pop.jl 
	calculates empirical p-values, runs PCA and clustering analyses
	requires population predictions and archaic predictions or pre-computed p-values

    comp_inds.jl 
	comparisons of predicted expression between archaic individuals
	requires archaic predictions

    gene_overlap.jl
	intersects gene models and SNPs or regions of interest
	requires lists of regions of interest

    model_weights.jl
	stats for comparing model weights between sets of SNPs
	requires model databases, SNP sets
