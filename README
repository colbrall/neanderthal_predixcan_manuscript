scripts/
    comp_pop.jl 
	calculates empirical p-values, runs PCA and clustering analyses
	requires population predictions and archaic predictions or pre-computed p-values

    comp_inds.jl 
	comparisons of predicted expression between archaic individuals
	requires archaic predictions

    gene_overlap.jl
	intersects gene models and SNPs or regions of interest
	requires lists of regions of interest

    human_dr.jl
        for a set of human IDs, calculates empirical P-value and call DR genes

    intro_individuals.jl
        for each gene, identifies individuals with certain alleles within 1Mb

    metric_summary_by_gene.jl
        generalized version of recombination_rate_map.jl; compares a metric (i.e. gene density) across sets of genes

    model_weights.jl
	stats for comparing model weights between sets of SNPs
	requires model databases, SNP sets

    neanderthal_predixcan_plots.ipynb
        Jupyter notebook for plotting

    PrediXcan.py
        code for performing PrediXcan predictions on genetic information. 
	adapted from script downloaded here on May 19, 2017: https://github.com/hakyimlab/PrediXcan/tree/master/Software

    recombination_rate_map.jl
        calculates recombination rate and summarizes for gene regions, then compares R.R. across gene sets.

data/
    *predExp.txt
	archaic predicted expression files-- genes x tissue matrix. altai_original indicated original genome called 
	for Altai neanderthal, used for most analyses. altai_update is the updated one used for comparisons to 
	other hominins.
	
    *pvalues_2sided.txt
	archaic 1kG empirical p-values-- genes x tissue matrix. matched to predExp file. A gene is DR in a tissue
	if this p-value equals zero. NA indicates that the gene was not successfully modelled in that tissue.
	
    altai_disgenet.txt
    	Disgenet enrichments for DR GWARRS. corresponds to fig. 2d.
	
    altai_dr_phewas.txt
	phenotype associations with differential regulation of DR GWARRs. Corresponds to figure 3 and Table 1.
	
    altai_desert_genes.txt
    	genes with at least 1 SNP in any of their tissue models that overlaps an introgression desert. Ensembl ids.
	
    altai_intro_genes.txt
	genes with at least 1 SNP in any of their tissue models that is on an introgressed haplotype (ie are non-GWARRs). 
	Anti-join this list and the genes in predixcan_model_summary.txt to get all GWARRs.
	
    altai_intro_genes_names.txt
    	human-readable names of the genes in the file above.
	
    altai_original_nonIntro_DR_genes.txt
    	ensembl ids for all DR GWARRs. locations plotted in figure 2b.
	
    altai_original_missingModels.txt
    	all genes for which the Altai genome was missing all SNPs in at least one tissue model. These were excluded 
	from analyses.
    
    gene-dersnp_intersection.txt
	genes by ensembl ID and counts of archaic-derived SNPs within 1Mb of them
	
    gene_region_neanSNPs.txt.gz
        for each gene, list of introgressed SNPs (by rsID) within 1 Mb (ie the region considered by PrediXcan). 
	
    DR_crossSpeces_GO.tgz
	cross-species GO analyses- overlap of DR genes. Corresponds to figure 5b.
	
    diff_crossSpeces_GO.tgz
	cross-species GO analyses- absolute difference in regulation. corresponds to figure 5c.
	
    gencode.v12.annotation.bed.gz
    	hg19 gene locations. A gene's location is considered to be all bases covered by at least 1 version of the gene.

predixcan_model_summary.txt
    	summary of all predixcan models in all tissues. models described by ensembl id, and includes model performance 
	(R2 for observed/predicted in training), number of snps in the model, number of those SNPs that were 
	missing in Altai_original, number of introgressed SNPs in the model, number of SNPs shared between AMH and 
	Altai, and the empirical p-value for divergent regulation (same as in altai_original_pvalues_2sided.txt)
